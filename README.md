# Postgram

Postgram is a social media platform that I developed as a personal project to showcase my skills in Python backend development. It is inspired by popular social media platforms.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python, Django Rest Framework.
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React for user interface development.
- Database: PostgreSQL for storing user and post information.
- Authentication and Authorization: JSON Web Token.
- Caching: Redis for post caching.
- Testing: PyTest for backend testing (30+ tests).
- Deployment: AWS.
- Additional Tools: Docker, NGINX, GitHub CI/CD.

## Project Highlights

During the development of Postgram, I focused on creating a user-friendly interface, optimizing performance, and ensuring data security. I implemented various features such as user authentication, data validation, and error handling to enhance the platform's usability and reliability.

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in Python programming, web development, and database management. It challenged me to consider scalability, security, and user experience throughout the development process. I thoroughly enjoyed building Postgram and am proud of the final product.
