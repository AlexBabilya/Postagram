# Postgram

Postgram is a social media service developed as a pet project to showcase my skills in backend development. It follows the typical social media platform concept, allowing users to create posts, interact with other users' posts, and engage in social networking activities.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python with Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building the server-side logic.
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for developing the user interface.
- Database: PostgreSQL for storing user and post information.
- Authentication and Authorization: JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure user authentication and authorization.
- Caching: Redis for efficient post caching, improving performance and responsiveness.
- Testing: PyTest for writing and running backend tests, ensuring code reliability (30+ tests).
- Deployment: AWS for hosting and deploying the application.
- Additional Tools: Docker for containerization, NGINX for web server configuration, and GitHub CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment.

## Backend Development Highlights

In the development of Postgram, I focused extensively on backend development to build a robust and scalable server-side architecture. Some key highlights of the backend development include:

- **Python and Django Rest Framework:** Leveraging the power of Python and DRF to create a flexible and efficient backend that handles user authentication, post management, and various social networking features.
- **Database Management:** Utilizing PostgreSQL to store and manage user and post data, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing database queries for improved performance.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing JWT-based authentication and authorization to secure user accounts, protect user data, and enable seamless user sessions.
- **Caching with Redis:** Utilizing Redis as a caching mechanism to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed posts and reducing database queries.
- **Testing with PyTest:** Writing comprehensive backend tests using PyTest to validate the functionality, verify edge cases, and ensure the stability of the application.
- **Deployment on AWS:** Deploying the application on AWS, leveraging its scalable infrastructure to handle user traffic and provide a reliable and responsive experience.

## Frontend Development

The frontend development of Postgram involved using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create an engaging and intuitive user interface. While the frontend is an essential part of the project, the primary focus of this pet project was on backend development.

## Project Scope and Future Enhancements

Postgram is a functional social media service developed as a pet project. However, there are several areas where it can be further enhanced and expanded. Some potential future enhancements include:

- **Real-time Updates:** Implementing real-time updates using technologies like WebSockets to provide instant notifications and live feed updates.
- **Advanced Search Functionality:** Adding advanced search capabilities, such as filtering posts by tags, location, or user attributes, to improve user experience and content discovery.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Incorporating machine learning algorithms to provide personalized content recommendations, sentiment analysis, or spam detection.
- **Social Sharing and Integration:** Enabling users to share posts on other popular social media platforms and integrating with external APIs for enhanced functionality.

## Conclusion

Postgram has been an exciting project that allowed me to sharpen my backend development skills using Python, Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQL, and various related technologies. Through the development process, I gained valuable experience in building scalable server-side architectures, ensuring data security, and optimizing performance.
